            "Punchlight Foundation played a vital role in changing my life.
            Earlier I used to sell vegetables from a handcart all the time, but
            after joining the organization, I got a chance to work as an actor
            in street plays. This experience increased my confidence and skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, with the help of Punchlight Foundation, I am working as
            Junior Officer, Skill Enhancement & Entrepreneurship at Learning
            Links Foundation. My financial condition has improved, and my family
            is now doing well.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thank Punchlight Foundation from the bottom of my heart for giving
            me this opportunity and recognizing my potential."
